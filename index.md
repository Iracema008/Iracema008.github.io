### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was interesting since I got to experiment with different bread, meat, and condiment combinations. This was one of the first laboratories to experiment with arguments and their sizes, and it was a lot of fun.
* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was my personal favorite since I was always drawn by the individuals who created computer animations. I  utilized an input file stream to regulate the duration of the animations. I had a nice time looking at every available animation file.
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 is intriguing because I was always curious about how sorting correctly spelled words work. I could implement knowledge from the previous lab and open the files to write code to sort them correctly.
